# The Linux Command Line

## Introduction

### Why Use the Command Line?
> It's been said that “**graphical user interfaces make easy tasks easy**, while **command line interfaces make difficult tasks possible**” and this is still very true today.

### How To Read Book The Linux Command Line
> **Start at the beginning of the book and follow it to the end**. It isn’t written as a reference work, it's really more like a story with a beginning, middle, and end. 


### Why I Don't Call It “GNU/Linux”
> **“Linux” refers to the kernel** and all the other free and open source software found in the typical Linux distribution, that is, the entire Linux 
ecosystem, not just the GNU components.

## 1 - What Is the Shell

### What is the shell
> When we speak of the command line, we are really referring to the **shell**. 

> **The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out.** Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called 
bash. 

> The name “**bash**” is an acronym for “Bourne Again SHell”, a reference to the fact **bash is an** **enhanced replacement for sh**, the original Unix shell program written by **Steve Bourne**.

> **Terminal Emulators** provide the access to the shell.
